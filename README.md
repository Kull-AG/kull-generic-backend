# ﻿﻿The Kull Generic BackendThis package allows Integration of a generic Stored Procedure-based Backend to Asp.Net MVC CoreIt uses Swashbuckle, Version 5+## ConfigurationIn Startup.cs, add the following services:```CSharpusing Kull.GenericBackend;// ...public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services){		services.AddMvcCore().AddApiExplorer(); //Or AddMvc() depending on your needs		services.AddGenericBackend(null, new Kull.GenericBackend.SwaggerGeneration.SwaggerFromSPOptions() {		});		services.AddSwaggerGen(c=> {			c.SwaggerDoc("v1", new OpenApiInfo { Title = "My API", Version = "v1" });			c.AddGenericBackend();		});}public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env){	app.UseSwagger(o =>    {		// For compat with ng-swagger-gen on client. You can use ng-openapi-gen if set to false        o.SerializeAsV2 = true;    });    app.UseMvc(routeBuilder=>    {		// The package relies on integrated routing of Asp.net MVC Core        app.UseGenericBackend(routeBuilder);    });    // If needed, Swagger UI    app.UseSwaggerUI(c =>    {        c.SwaggerEndpoint("/swagger/v1/swagger.json", "My API V1");    });}```In appsettings.json, set the connection string and the URI's:```json{  "ConnectionStrings": {    "Default": "Data Source=cn413.kull.ch;Initial Catalog=UHR;Integrated Security=True"  },  "Entities": {    "Cases": {      "Get": "api.spGetCases"    },    "Cases/{CaseId|int}/Arrangements": {      "Get": "api.spGetArrangements",      "Post": "api.spAddUpdateArrangements"    }  }}```In the "Entities" Section, the URL's are configured. Each entry correspondends to a URL.Each URL can be accessed by multiple HTTP Methods. Allowed are:- GET	for getting data, shoud NEVER update something- POST	for adding/updating. Maybe misused for getting data if the url gets longer then 2000 chars otherwise)- PUT	for updating data- DELETE for deleting dataIn the URL there can be route constraints as in MVC, however the | is used instead of :because of limitations of appsettings.jsonFor a full documentation of allowed route constraints, please see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/routing?view=aspnetcore-2.1#route-constraint-reference)For best practices for defining a REST Api, see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/api-design)### Multi-value parametersTo use multiple values for a parameter, use a Sql Server User Defined Table Typefor the parameter.```sql-- Create the data type
CREATE TYPE dbo.IdNameType AS TABLE 
(
	Id bigint, 
	Name nvarchar(1000), 
    PRIMARY KEY (Id)
)
GO-- Create SP
CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.spTestBackend
	@SomeId int,
	@Ids dbo.IdNameType readonly
AS
BEGIN
	-- ...
END```## Main parts of the generic API### Middleware for handling the requestsThe main part of the project is the Middleware that handles stored procedures.It is responsible for handling a request against some URL defined in the Entities Section,as seen above.### Middleware for SwaggerThe other part is the middleware that is responsible for generating a swagger.json fileout of the information of the database. This is done by using the [sp_describe_first_result_set](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-describe-first-result-set-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017)and INFORMATION_SCHEMA.parametersIt works by adding an IDocumentFilter to Swashbuckle. Swashbuckle generates the swagger.jsonThis means you can mix this backend and your own Controllers and it will just work in the swagger.json.### Special parametersThere are so called System Parameters, which are parameters defined in any Stored Procedurewhich should be resolved by the Webserver and not by the Consumer of the API. Built-in are the following System Parameters:- ADLogin & NTLogin: The Username in the HttpContext- IPAddress: The IP Adress of the User- UserAgent: The UserAgent of the BrowserIf you would like to add something to this, you can Subclass the SystemParameters classand replace the default implementation by using Asp.Net Core Dependency Injection.# Possible futher development- Port to .Net Core 3.0- Direct manipulation of tables/views without Stored Procedures- Support for other databases, eg Sqlite for Testing- More Unit Tests
